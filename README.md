## General Information
FlashCards App is an interactive vocabulary learning application that utilizes flashcards for efficient word memorization. The app allows users to train and practice new words by reviewing and translating flashcards.
 
## Technologies Used
The project utilizes the following technologies and frameworks:

- Programming Languages: Java, HTML, CSS.
- Backend Framework: Spring Boot, Hibernate.
- Database Management: MS SQL.
- Frontend Frameworks: Thymeleaf.
- REST API.
- Maven.
- Version Control: Git.
- Deployment: Docker.
- Testing: JUnit, Mockito.

## External APIs:;
-  OpenAI GPT-3 API
To provide the interactive word translation feature, the application utilizes the OpenAI GPT-3 API. The API is an advanced language model developed by OpenAI. It is used for generating text-based responses based on given inputs.

Configuring the OpenAI GPT-3 API:
- Register on the OpenAI website and obtain access to the GPT-3 API.
